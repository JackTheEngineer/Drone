# Todos
## Build system

   * write haskell runner generator
   * "all" target runs "uC" and "tests", needs an argument for "YACBS.hs all bld/uC.ucbuild"

## Hardware

   * make two different SPI implementations possible for RFM75 code
   * Test speed increase in SPI ( relating to only code change, not frequency )

## Testing the Code:
   * Either Continue Euler Integral Simulation
     - Find out moments of the Motors
     - Find propeller masses
     - Find and set constants for fake_motors.h
     
   * Find a 3D simulator and adapt it to my code
   
## Motion Sensor

   * Implement quaternion rotation
