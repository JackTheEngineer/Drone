# Todos
## Build system

   * "all" target runs hardcoded specified targets and "tests", needs  for
     like "stack runghc bld/YACBS.hs all"

## Hardware

   * make two different SPI implementations possible for RFM75 code
   * Test speed increase in SPI ( relating to only code change, not frequency )
      - Optionally, for speedup implement the spi with transfer functions

   * check what's wrong with the rxtx_interrupt

   * DAVE rename pin interrupt handler to USR IRQ Handler



## Testing the Code:
   * Compile with -02

   * Either Continue Euler Integral Simulation
     - Find out moments of the Motors
     - Find propeller masses
     - Find and set constants for fake_motors.h
     
   * Find a 3D simulator and adapt it to my code / or my code to it
   
## Motion Sensor
   * Implement quaternion rotation
