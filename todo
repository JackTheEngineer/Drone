# Todos
## Build system

   * "all" target runs hardcoded specified targets and "tests", needs  for
     like "stack runghc bld/YACBS.hs all"

## Hardware
   * rename XMC1100 DBG_UART to DEBUG_UART

   * Test UART over predefinded DEBUG USB for drone and remotecontrol

   * on transmit and receive send rfm75 transmission information over uart

   * write a haskell parser for the transmission information

   * test RFM75 data tranmission from Primary RX device to Primary TX device.

   * for -O2 ---> try using SPI config app, and test 'coded' version of clock select signal,
     and 32 fifo buffer bytes.

   PRIO 2:
   * Optionally, for speedup implement the spi with TRANSFER functions

## Testing the Code:
   * Either Continue Euler Integral Simulation
     - Find out moments of the Motors
     - Find propeller masses
     - Find and set constants for fake_motors.h
     
   * Find a 3D simulator and adapt it to my code / or my code to it
   
## Motion Sensor
   * Implement quaternion rotation
